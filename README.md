Most of my knowledge of front end web dev came from the Front End Web Dev bootcamp course by FreeCodeCamp, see the link below.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this challenge, I gained more experience navigating the DOM using JavaScript as well as working with flexbox.

### Continued development

In the future I plan to do even more advanced things with flexbox, responsive design, and JavaScript.
